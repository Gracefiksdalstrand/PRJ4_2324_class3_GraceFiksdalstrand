	<p class="myfont">I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Project Assistant internship position at Ophelix, as advertised on your website.</p> <p> With my enthusiasm for event management, strong organizational skills, and passion for delivering exceptional experiences, I am eager to contribute to your team and gain invaluable industry experience. Gaining experience in either Oslo or Arendal my home town would be desirable. </p>
	<p>My previous experiences have equipped me with a solid event production and management foundation. Having organized Breda University of Applied Sciences AGM department's Open Days this year together with a team, I've been able to pursue my passion and gain experience in different roles within a team. During the first Open Day, I was the volunteer coordinator, responsible for coordinating 60 student volunteers. On the second Open Day, I was the Project Manager for the AGM team as well ensuring the smooth running and success of the entire event. For the third Open Day, I will be responsible for planning the floor plan and design experience, requiring me to apply spatial location design thinking.  These experiences involving every aspect of event planning, from conceptualization to execution, align perfectly with my career aspirations.</p><br>

I am inspired by your approach to sourcing off-the-beaten-track activities and your attention to detail in every aspect of destination management. I am eager to contribute my creativity and resourcefulness to help enhance the company's offerings and exceed client satisfaction.
